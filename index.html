        </div>
        <div class="right">
          <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Government at Cornell University. My   research and teaching interests include comparative politics, state-building, and   historical institutional development, with a regional focus on Latin America. My   dissertation examines decisive historical periods in Mexico and Colombia to   investigate the origins of sub-national variation in state capacity and   institutional strength. I conducted extensive fieldwork in both countries between   2015 and 2016. Using previously untapped archival sources, I show how insurgency   and political cleavages during formative periods of the state shaped state capacity   outcomes in various dimensions.  My research has been supported by grants from   Fulbright, the Mexico National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT), and the   Social Science Research Council (SSRC).</p>
          <p>I am also interested on issues of political representation, political parties, and   elections. A co-authored book chapter on the historical roots of democratic party   system institutionalization in Mexico is forthcoming with Cambridge University   Press.

          <p>Why do states develop more effective authority in parts of their territory and   domains of governance than in others? Despite the importance of state capacity for   political order, economic development, equal access to citizenship rights, and   other outcomes, the rise of effective states and the causes of chronic   institutional weakness are not well understood. Moreover, few studies have sought   to systematically explain the vast differences in state capacity that exist within   countries, although this unevenness is a defining feature of many contemporary   states.</p>
  
          <p>My dissertation examines the historical development of state (in)capacity in   Mexico and Colombia from a subnational perspective. It presents a theoretical   framework to explain variation in the state’s ability to perform core functions   within its territory, centered on the social and political composition of   state-building coalitions during formative periods of the state. I argue that this   configuration of interests shapes subnational patterns of societal support and   resistance to statebuilding projects, which in turn enduringly affect institutional   development and state capacity outcomes in various dimensions.</p>
  
          <p>I test the argument using within-country historical analysis, case studies, and   novel historical datasets compiled through extensive archival research in both   countries. Drawing on original, disaggregated data on the incidence of violent   conflict and state performance, the analysis shows that insurgent activity after   the Mexican Revolution systematically and enduringly affected the postrevolutionary   state’s ability to exercise fiscal authority and monopolize violence. It also   reveals that patterns of state capacity development in Colombia followed a partisan   logic, with decisive periods of statebuilding under the Liberal Party leaving a   legacy of lower institutional capacity in more Conservative areas.</p>
  
          <p>I demonstrate that these political factors matter for explaining domestic   variation in state strength even after accounting for differences in socioeconomic   development, geographical conditions, preexisting levels of state capacity, and   other variables. The study has important implications for our understanding of the   process of statebuilding across geographic space, the origins of state capacity,   and the political roots of institutional weakness.</p>

          <p>“Building the Modern State in Developing Countries: Understanding the   Relationship between Order and Taxes with Evidence from Mexico.” (With Gustavo   Flores-Macías)</p>
        
          <p>What is the relationship between two central aspects of state capacity, namely   taxation and order? This research contributes to answering this question by   studying the determinants of citizens’ willingness to pay (WTP) taxes for improved   public safety, and how much they would pay. In particular, we evaluate the role   that victimization, objective safety conditions, perceptions of public safety, and   socioeconomic status play in shaping citizens’ willingness to grant more resources   to the state. Drawing on original, nationally representative survey evidence and a   novel technique to estimate the value of non-market goods such as public safety, we   test how these different factors affect individual WTP taxes for a 30% reduction in   crime in Mexico—one of the countries in Latin America with the lowest fiscal   extraction and hardest hit by the wave of criminal violence that has plagued   democracies in the region.</p>
  
          <p>Contrary to expectations from the literatures on victimization and state   intervention as risk mitigation, we find that WTP taxes is driven by perceptions of   public safety: those with negative perceptions of public safety are less inclined   to pay taxes to reduce crime. Additionally, those with higher income are more   likely to express willingness to pay a greater amount in taxes, but lower income   groups are willing to make proportionally larger contributions relative to their   household income.</p>
